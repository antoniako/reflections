When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When  wanting to share my repository with others (e.g. team project, applyng for a job).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because the remote repository might have changes which are not consistent with the version in the local repository.
